<h1>A guide to failing, With Tarek</h1>

<p>
Step 1: Do NOT turn up to school, Monday to Tuesday and Thursday to Friday
<br>
Step 2: On the day that you are at school, make sure to copy paste all the infomation you can find, but.. in Tarek style, do not remove hyperlinks from your work so it is easily discovered 
that you have plagiarised someones work.
<br>
Step 3: When attempting to leave school early, make sure you only jump the fence when you have atleast an entire year 12 exam room watching you
<br>
Final Step: After you have successfully failed, make sure to get super defensive whenever someone brings it up.
